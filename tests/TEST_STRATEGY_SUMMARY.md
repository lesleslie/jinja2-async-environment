# jinja2-async-environment Test Strategy Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive testing strategy for the jinja2-async-environment library, addressing current issues and planning for future improvements.

## Current Status

### Test Coverage

- **Current Coverage**: ~41%
- **Target Coverage**: 90%+
- **Coverage Gap**: 49%+ needs to be covered

### Failed Tests

- **Total Failed Tests**: 61
- **Error Tests**: 17
- **Passed Tests**: 251
- **Skipped Tests**: 13

## Immediate Fixes Required

### 1. Constructor Signature Issues (High Priority)

- **AsyncFunctionLoader**: Fix tests to pass only 1 parameter instead of 2
- **AsyncChoiceLoader**: Fix tests to pass only 1 parameter instead of 2

### 2. Method Signature Issues (High Priority)

- **get_source_async**: Fix method calls to include required `name` parameter
- **environment parameter**: Fix method calls to properly pass environment parameter

### 3. Import Issues (Medium Priority)

- **AsyncPackageLoader**: Fix missing import_module in loaders module

### 4. Initialization Issues (Medium Priority)

- **AsyncDictLoader**: Fix searchpath initialization

## Test Improvement Areas

### 1. Core Module Coverage

| Module | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Gap |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|-----|

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes (Week 1)

1. Fix constructor signature issues
1. Fix method signature issues
1. Fix import issues
1. Fix initialization issues
1. **Goal**: Get all tests passing

### Phase 2: Core Coverage Improvement (Weeks 2-3)

1. Add missing unit tests for all modules
1. Improve coverage for low-coverage modules
1. Add integration tests for loader combinations
1. **Goal**: Reach 70%+ coverage

### Phase 3: Performance Testing (Week 4)

1. Implement benchmark tests for all core operations
1. Add concurrency stress tests
1. Add memory usage tests
1. **Goal**: Establish performance baseline

### Phase 4: Advanced Testing (Weeks 5-6)

1. Add backward compatibility tests
1. Add real-world scenario tests
1. Add security tests (for sandboxed environment)
1. **Goal**: Reach 90%+ coverage

## Success Metrics

### 1. Test Coverage

- **Minimum**: 90% overall coverage
- **Modules**: 100% coverage for core modules
- **Files**: No file with < 80% coverage

### 2. Performance

- **Rendering**: Maintain or improve current performance
- **Compilation**: Maintain or improve current performance
- **Loading**: Maintain or improve current performance
- **Concurrency**: Handle 1000+ concurrent requests

### 3. Stability

- **Test Failures**: Zero in CI/CD pipeline
- **Performance Regression**: < 5% degradation
- **Compatibility**: 100% backward compatibility

### 4. Documentation

- **Test Coverage**: All new tests documented
- **API Changes**: All changes documented
- **Migration Guide**: Clear upgrade path for users

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Continuous Integration

- All tests run on every commit
- Performance regression monitoring
- Code coverage reporting
- Security scanning

### Release Process

- All tests must pass before release
- Performance benchmarks must be maintained
- Backward compatibility must be preserved
- Documentation must be updated

## Risk Mitigation

### Test Flakiness

- Use deterministic test data
- Mock time-dependent operations
- Clear caches between tests
- Use proper async test fixtures

### Performance Variance

- Run benchmarks multiple times
- Use statistical analysis
- Account for system load
- Set reasonable tolerances

### Compatibility Testing

- Test all Python versions
- Test all import patterns
- Test upgrade scenarios
- Test rollback procedures

## Conclusion

This comprehensive test strategy addresses the current issues with the jinja2-async-environment library while establishing a solid foundation for future growth. By following this roadmap, we can:

1. **Fix current issues** and get all tests passing
1. **Improve coverage** to 90%+ across all modules
1. **Establish performance baselines** with comprehensive benchmarking
1. **Ensure backward compatibility** for existing users
1. **Maintain high quality** through continuous integration and monitoring

The implementation is planned in phases to ensure steady progress without overwhelming the development process, with clear success metrics to track progress and ensure quality.
